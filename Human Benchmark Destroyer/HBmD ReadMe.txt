# humanbenchmark.com was intended to test human reflexes and abilities and observe the resulting distributions
# therefore a non-human participant should be able to rise above the competition easily
# Four projects so far:
    # 1. Long number memorization and re-entry
    # 2. Color change reflex speed test, click screen as soon as it does
#         advanced goal - tweak the response time so the function clicks at as close to 100ms as possible without being faster
#             to bypass the website's filter/rule thing
    # 3. Remember whether a word has been repeated or not, press yes or no
    # 4. Remember a pattern of highlighted squares in a large matrix, click on highlighted squares in timed succession 
    
    
    
# note - you should probably make a folder titled 'humanbenchmarkdestroyer' and place each individual project in an
# individual .ipynb file, for neatness
